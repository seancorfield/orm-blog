orm-blog
========

A very simple blog/cms built in ColdFusion using FW/1 and ORM.

I'm building this because I want to make a site to showcase what I am capable of. It seems like a bit of a cop-out to use something pre-built.

This project requires 2 things:
1. Lots of work.
2. FW/1 - it is current included in the project, but only because I forgot to create a gitignore file.
	- This project will (hopefully) be updated more or less alongside FW/1, so there will be LOTS of changes.
